#A Taste of AngularJS

This is a basic one hour workshop based on Dan Wahlin's talk / screencast 'AngularJS
Fundamentals in 60-ish Minutes'. When you first download this project, you will have the final working demo app. The best way to work through this workshop is to follow along with each of the steps using the following order. Each of these is an html in this project. Simply open each file in order to see the major steps along the path to building this simple app.

## Install

To view the course material, navigate to the projects root folder in your terminal and run

```bash
$ rackup
```

You should now be able to visit `http://localhost:9292` and view the course.

> Make sure you have ruby installed on your system. If you see an error like "-bash: rackup: command not found", then install the ruby rack server with `gem install rack` and try again.
