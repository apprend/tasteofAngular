  <div ng-init='theWho=["Roger Daltry", "Pete Townsend", "Keith Moon"]' >
    <p>Here's our source data - each section below uses an angular filter to transform this dataset in some way.</p>
    <pre><code>{{theWho}}</code></pre>

    <h3>Members of The Who, uppercase</h3>
    <ul>
      <li ng-repeat="member in theWho ">{{ member | uppercase }}</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- The uppercase filter is a built in filter that will transform the data before it is presented on the page -->

    <h3>Members of The Who, alphabetical order</h3>
    <ul>
      <li ng-repeat="member in theWho | orderBy:member">{{ member }}</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- The orderBy filter is a built in filter that will reorder the data set based on a pre-determined property -->

    <h3>Members of The Who, reverse alphabetical order</h3>
    <ul>
      <li ng-repeat="member in theWho | orderBy:'-member'">{{ member }}</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- The orderBy filter is a built in filter that will reorder the data set based on a pre-determined property -->

    <h3>Members of The Grateful Dead, filtered by name</h3>

    <div class="form-group">
      <label>Type a name to filter the list: </label>
      <input type="text" ng-model="membersNameOrInstrument" class="form-control">
    </div>

    <ul ng-init="theGratefulDead=[{name: 'Jerry Garcia', instrument: 'guitar, vocals'}, {name: 'Bob Weir', instrument: 'guitar, vocals'}, {name: 'Ron \'Pigpen\' McKernan', instrument: 'keyboards, harmonica, vocals'},{name: 'Phil Lesh', instrument: 'bass, vocals'}, {name: 'Bill Kreutzmann', instrument: 'drums'}]">
      <li ng-repeat="bandmate in theGratefulDead | filter: membersNameOrInstrument | orderBy: 'name' | limitTo: 3">{{ bandmate.name }} : {{ bandmate.instrument }} </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- The filter filter (?!) allows a fuzzy search to be made of the data array -->
